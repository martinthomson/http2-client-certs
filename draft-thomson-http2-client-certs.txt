       Reactive Certificate-Based Client Authentication in HTTP/2
                draft-thomson-http2-client-certs-latest

Abstract

   Some HTTP servers provide a subset of resources that require
   additional authentication to interact with.  HTTP/1.1 servers rely on
   TLS renegotiation that is triggered by a request to a protected
   resource.  HTTP/2 made this pattern impossible by forbidding the use
   of TLS renegotiation.  While TLS 1.3 provides an alternate mechanism
   to obtain client certificates, this mechanism does not map well to
   usage in TLS 1.2.

   This document describes a how client authentication might be
   requested by a server as a result of receiving a request to a
   protected resource.

1.  Introduction

   Many existing HTTP [RFC7230] servers have different authentication
   requirements for the different resources they serve.  Of the
   bountiful authentication options available for authenticating HTTP
   requests, client certificates present a unique challenge for
   resource-specific authentication requirements because of the
   interaction with the underlying TLS RFC5246 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]
   layer.

   For servers that wish to use client certificates to authenticate
   users, they might request client authentication during or immediately
   after the TLS handshake.  However, if not all users or resources need
   certificate-based authentication, a request for a certificate has the
   unfortunate consequence of triggering the client to seek a
   certificate.  Such a request can result in a poor experience,
   particularly when sent to a client that does not expect the request.

   The TLS 1.3 CertificateRequest can be used by servers to give clients
   hints about which certificate to offer.  Servers that rely on
   certificate-based authentication might request different certificates
   for different resources.  Such a server cannot use contextual
   information about the resource to construct an appropriate TLS
   CertificateRequest message during the initial handshake.

   Consequently, client certificates are requested at connection
   establishment time only in cases where all clients are expected or
   required to have a single certificate that is used for all resources.
   Many other uses for client certificates are reactive, that is,
   certificates are requested in response to the client making a
   request.

   In Yokohama, there was extensive working group discussion regarding
   why certificate authentication could not easily be done at the HTTP
   semantic layer.  However, in subsequent discussion, it became
   apparent that the HTTP _framing_ layer did not suffer from the same
   limitation.

   In this document, a mechanism for doing certificate-based client
   authentication via HTTP/2 frames is defined.  This mechanism can be
   implemented at the HTTP layer without requiring new TLS stack
   behavior and without breaking the existing interface between HTTP and
   applications which employ client certificates.

1.1.  Reactive Certificate Authentication in HTTP/1.1

1.1.1.  Using TLS 1.2 and previous

   In HTTP/1.1, a server that relies on client authentication for a
   subset of users or resources does not request a certificate when the
   connection is established.  Instead, it only requests a client
   certificate when a request is made to a resource that requires a
   certificate.  TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] accomodates this by permitting the
   server to request a new TLS handshake, in which the server will
   request the client's certificate.

   Figure 1 shows the server initiating a TLS-layer renegotiation in
   response to receiving an HTTP/1.1 request to a protected resource.

   Client                                      Server
      -- (HTTP) GET /protected -------------------> *1
      <---------------------- (TLS) HelloRequest -- *2
      -- (TLS) ClientHello ----------------------->
      <------------------ (TLS) ServerHello, ... --
      <---------------- (TLS) CertificateRequest -- *3
      -- (TLS) ..., Certificate ------------------> *4
      -- (TLS) Finished -------------------------->
      <-------------------------- (TLS) Finished --
      <--------------------------- (HTTP) 200 OK -- *5

    Figure 1: HTTP/1.1 Reactive Certificate Authentication with TLS 1.2

   In this example, the server receives a request for a protected
   resource (at *1 on Figure 1).  Upon performing an authorization
   check, the server determines that the request requires authentication
   using a client certificate and that no such certificate has been
   provided.

   The server initiates TLS renegotiation by sending a TLS HelloRequest
   (at *2).  The client then initiates a TLS handshake.  Note that some
   TLS messages are elided from the figure for the sake of brevity.

   The critical messages for this example are the server requesting a
   certificate with a TLS CertificateRequest (*3); this request might
   use information about the request or resource.  The client then
   provides a certificate and proof of possession of the private key in
   Certificate and CertificateVerify messages (*4).

   When the handshake completes, the server performs any authorization
   checks a second time.  With the client certificate available, it then
   authorizes the request and provides a response (*5).

1.1.2.  Using TLS 1.3

   TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] introduces a new client authentication
   mechanism that allows for clients to authenticate after the handshake
   has been completed.  For the purposes of authenticating an HTTP
   request, this is functionally equivalent to renegotiation.  Figure 2
   shows the simpler exchange this enables.

   Client                                      Server
      -- (HTTP) GET /protected ------------------->
      <---------------- (TLS) CertificateRequest --
      -- (TLS) Certificate, CertificateVerify ---->
      <--------------------------- (HTTP) 200 OK --

    Figure 2: HTTP/1.1 Reactive Certificate Authentication with TLS 1.3

   TLS 1.3 does not support renegotiation, instead supporting direct
   client authentication.  In contrast to the TLS 1.2 example, in TLS
   1.3, a server can simply request a certificate.

1.2.  Reactive Client Authentication in HTTP/2

   An important part of the HTTP/1.1 exchange is that the client is able
   to easily identify the request that caused the TLS renegotiation.
   The client is able to assume that the next unanswered request on the
   connection is responsible.  The HTTP stack in the client is then able
   to direct the certificate request to the application or component
   that initiated that request.  This ensures that the application has
   the right contextual information for processing the request.

   In HTTP/2, a client can have multiple outstanding requests.  Without
   some sort of correlation information, a client is unable to identify
   which request caused the server to request a certificate.

   Thus, the minimum necessary mechanism to support reactive certificate
   authentication in HTTP/2 is an identifier that can be use to
   correlate an HTTP request with a request for a certificate.

   Such an identifier could be added to TLS 1.2 by means of an
   extension, but many TLS 1.2 implementations do not permit application
   data to continue during a renegotiation.  This is problematic for a
   multiplexed protocol like HTTP/2.  Instead, this draft proposes
   bringing the TLS 1.3 CertificateRequest, Certificate, and
   CertificateVerify messages into HTTP/2 frames, making client
   certificate authentication TLS-version-agnostic.

   This could be done in a naive manner by replicating the messages as
   HTTP/2 frames on each stream.  However, this would create needless

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs                March 2016


   redundancy between streams and require frequent expensive signing
   operations.  Instead, this draft lifts the bulky portions of each
   message into frames on stream zero and permits the on-stream frames
   to incorporate them by reference as needed.

   On each stream where certificate authentication is required, the
   server sends a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame, which the client answers
   with a "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame either indicating the certificate to
   use, or indicating that no certificate should be used.  These frames
   are simple, referencing information previously sent on stream zero to
   reduce redundancy.

   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frames reference a "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" on
   stream zero, analogous to the CertificateRequest message.
   "USE_CERTIFICATE" frames reference a sequence of "CERTIFICATE" and
   "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frames on stream zero, analogous to the the
   Certificate and CertificateVerify messages.

   The exchange then looks like this:

   Client                                      Server
      -- (streams 1,3) GET /protected ------------>
      <---------- (stream 0) CERTIFICATE_REQUEST --
      <------ (streams 1,3) CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED --
      -- (stream 0) CERTIFICATE ------------------>
      -- (stream 0) CERTIFICATE_PROOF ------------>
      -- (streams 1,3) USE_CERTIFICATE ----------->
      <-------------------- (streams 1,3) 200 OK --


           Figure 3: HTTP/2 Reactive Certificate Authentication

   To avoid the extra round-trip per stream required for a challenge and
   response, the "AUTOMATIC_USE" flag enables a certificate to be
   automatically used by the server on subsequent requests without
   sending a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" exchange.

   Section 2 describes how certificates can be requested and presented
   at the HTTP/2 framing layer using several new frame types which
   parallel the TLS 1.3 message exchange.  Section 3 defines new error
   types which can be used to notify peers when the exchange has not
   been successful.  Finally, Section 4 describes how an HTTP/2 client
   can announce support for this feature so that a server might use
   these capabilities.

1.3.  Terminology

   RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the terms "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and
   "MAY".

2.  Presenting Client Certificates at the HTTP/2 Framing Layer

   An HTTP/2 request from a client that has signaled support for
   reactive certificate authentication (see Section 4) might cause a
   server to request client authentication.  In HTTP/2 a server does
   this by sending at least one "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame (see
   Section 2.3) on stream zero and sending a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED"
   frame (see Section 2.1) on the affected stream(s).  The
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" and "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frames are
   correlated by their "Request-ID" field.  Subsequent
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frames with the same Request-ID MAY be sent on
   other streams where the server is expecting client authentication
   with the same parameters.

   A server MAY send multiple concurrent "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frames
   on the same stream.  If a server requires that a client provide
   multiple certificates before authorizing a single request, it MUST
   send a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame with a different request
   identifier and a corresponding "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame describing
   each required certificate.

   Clients respond to requests by sending one or more "CERTIFICATE"
   frames (see Section 2.4), followed by a "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame
   (see Section 2.5), on stream zero containing the "Request-ID" to
   which they are responding.  The "USE_CERTIFICATE" (see Section 2.2)
   frame is sent on-stream to notify the server the stream is ready to
   be processed.

   To reduce round-trips, the client MAY set the "AUTOMATIC_USE" flag on
   a "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame, indicating that the server SHOULD
   automatically apply the supplied certificate to any future streams
   matching that request, rather than sending a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED"
   frame.

2.1.  The CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED frame

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame (0xFRAME-TBD2) is sent by servers to
   indicate that processing of an HTTP request is blocked pending
   certificate authentication.  The frame includes a request identifier
   which can be used to correlate the stream with a previous
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame received on stream zero.  The
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" describes the client certificate the server
   requires to process the request.

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs                March 2016


   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame contains 1 octet, which is the
   authentication request identifier.  A client that receives a
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" of any other length MUST treat this as a
   stream error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".  Frames with identical request
   identifiers refer to the same "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST".

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame MUST NOT be sent by clients.  A
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame received by a server SHOULD be rejected
   with a stream error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The server MUST NOT send a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame on stream
   zero, a server-initiated stream or a stream that does not have an
   outstanding request.  In other words, a server can only send in the
   "open" or "half-closed (remote)" stream states.

   A client that receives a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame on a stream
   which is not in a valid state ("open" or "half-closed (local)" for
   clients) SHOULD treat this as a connection error of type
   "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

2.2.  The USE_CERTIFICATE Frame

   The "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame (0xFRAME-TBD5) is sent by clients in
   response to a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame to indicate that the
   requested certificate has been provided (or will not be).

   A "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame with no payload expresses the client's
   refusal to use the associated certificate (if any) with this stream.
   If the request was originally issued for a different stream, servers
   MAY create a new "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" and permit the client to offer
   a different certificate.  Alternatively, servers MAY process the
   request as unauthenticated, likely returning an authentication-
   related error at the HTTP level (e.g. 403).

   Otherwise, the "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame contains the "Request-ID" of
   the now-completed certificate request.  This MUST be an ID previously
   issued by the server, and for which a matching certificate has
   previously been presented along with a supporting certificate chain
   in one or more "CERTIFICATE" frames, and for which proof of
   possession has been presented in a "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame.

   Use of the "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame by servers is not defined by this
   document.  A "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame received by a client MUST be
   ignored.

   The client MUST NOT send a "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame on stream zero, a
   server-initiated stream or a stream that does not have an outstanding
   request.  In other words, a client can only send in the "open" or

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs                March 2016


   "half-closed (local)" stream states.  The client MUST NOT send a
   "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame except in response to a
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame from the server.

   A server that receives a "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame on a stream which is
   not in a valid state ("open" or "half-closed (remote)" for servers),
   on which it has not sent a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame, or
   referencing a certificate it has not previously received SHOULD treat
   this as a connection error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

2.3.  The CERTIFICATE_REQUEST Frame

   TLS 1.3 defines the "CertificateRequest" message, which prompts the
   client to provide a certificate which conforms to certain properties
   specified by the server.  This draft defines the
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame (0xFRAME-TBD1), which contains the same
   contents as a TLS 1.3 "CertificateRequest" message, but can be sent
   over any TLS version.

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame MUST NOT be sent by clients.  A
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame received by a server SHOULD be rejected
   with a stream error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame MUST be sent on stream zero.  A
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame received on any other stream MUST be
   rejected with a stream error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

   The frame contains the following fields:

      algorithm pairs that the server is able to verify, listed in
      descending order of preference.  Any certificates provided by the

      client MUST be signed using a hash/signature algorithm pair found
      in "Algorithms".  Each algorithm pair is encoded as a
      "SignatureAndHashAlgorithm" (see [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] section
      6.3.2.1), and the number of such structures is given by the 16-bit
      "Algorithm-Count" field, which MUST NOT be zero.

   CA-Count and Certificate-Authorities:  "Certificate-Authorities" is a
      series of distinguished names of acceptable certificate
      authorities, represented in DER-encoded [X690] format.  These
      distinguished names may specify a desired distinguished name for a
      root CA or for a subordinate CA; thus, this message can be used to
      describe known roots as well as a desired authorization space.
      The number of such structures is given by the 16-bit "CA-Count"
      field, which MAY be zero.  If the "CA-Count" field is zero, then
      the client MAY send any certificate that meets the rest of the
      selection criteria in the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST", unless there is
      some external arrangement to the contrary.

   Cert-Extension-Count and Cert-Extensions:  A list of certificate
      extension OIDs [RFC5280] with their allowed values, represented in
      a series of "CertificateExtension" structures (see
      [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] section 6.3.5).  The list of OIDs MUST be
      used in certificate selection as described in
      [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  The number of Cert-Extension structures is
      given by the 16-bit "Cert-Extension-Count" field, which MAY be
      zero.

   Some certificate extension OIDs allow multiple values (e.g.  Extended
   Key Usage).  If the sender has included a non-empty
   certificate_extensions list, the certificate MUST contain all of the
   specified extension OIDs that the recipient recognizes.  For each
   extension OID recognized by the recipient, all of the specified
   values MUST be present in the certificate (but the certificate MAY
   have other values as well).  However, the recipient MUST ignore and
   skip any unrecognized certificate extension OIDs.

   PKIX RFCs define a variety of certificate extension OIDs and their
   corresponding value types.  Depending on the type, matching
   certificate extension values are not necessarily bitwise-equal.  It
   is expected that implementations will rely on their PKI libraries to
   perform certificate selection using these certificate extension OIDs.

2.4.  The CERTIFICATE frame

   A certificate chain is transferred as a series of "CERTIFICATE"
   frames (0xFRAME-TBD3) with the same Request-ID, each containing a
   single certificate in the chain.  The end certificate of the chain
   can be used as authentication for previous or subsequent requests.

   The "CERTIFICATE" frame defines no flags.

   While unlikely, it is possible that an exceptionally large
   certificate might be too large to fit in a single HTTP/2 frame (see
   [RFC7540] section 4.2).  Senders unable to transfer a requested
   certificate due to the recipient's "SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE" value
   SHOULD terminate affected streams with "CERTIFICATE_TOO_LARGE".

   Use of the "CERTIFICATE" frame by servers is not defined by this
   document.  A "CERTIFICATE" frame received by a client MUST be
   ignored.

   The "CERTIFICATE" frame MUST be sent on stream zero.  A "CERTIFICATE"
   frame received on any other stream MUST be rejected with a stream
   error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
    | Request-ID (8)|                Certificate (*)              ...
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+


                    Figure 5: CERTIFICATE frame payload

   The fields defined by the "CERTIFICATE" frame are:

   Request-ID:  The ID of the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" to which this frame
      responds.

   Certificate:  An X.509v3 [RFC5280] certificate in the sender's
      certificate chain.

   The first or only "CERTIFICATE" frame with a given Request-ID MUST
   contain the sender's certificate.  Each subsequent certificate SHOULD
   directly certify the certificate immediately preceding it.  A
   certificate which specifies a trust anchor MAY be omitted, provided
   that the recipient is known to already possess the relevant
   certificate.  (For example, because it was included in a
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST"'s Certificate-Authorities list.)

   The "Request-ID" field MUST contain the same value as the
   corresponding "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame, and the provided
   certificate chain MUST conform to the requirements expressed in the
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" to the best of the client's ability.
   Specifically:

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs                March 2016


   o  If the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" contained a non-empty "Certificate-
      Authorities" element, one of the certificates in the chain SHOULD
      be signed by one of the listed CAs.

   o  If the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" contained a non-empty "Cert-
      Extensions" element, the first certificate MUST match with regard
      to the extension OIDs recognized by the client.

   o  Each certificate that is not self-signed MUST be signed using a
      hash/signature algorithm listed in the "Algorithms" element.

   If these requirements are not satisfied, the server MAY at its
   discretion either process the request without client authentication,
   or respond with a stream error [RFC7540] on any stream where the
   certificate is used.  Section 3 defines certificate-related error
   codes which might be applicable.

   A client cannot provide different certificates in response to the
   same "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" for use on different streams.  A client
   that has already sent and proven a certificate, but does not wish to
   use it on a particular stream SHOULD send an empty "USE_CERTIFICATE"
   frame, refusing to use that certificate on that stream.

2.5.  The CERTIFICATE_PROOF Frame

   The "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame proves possession of the private key
   corresponding to an end certificate previously shown in a
   "CERTIFICATE" frame.

   The "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame defines one flag:

   AUTOMATIC_USE (0x01):  Indicates that the certificate can be used
      automatically on future requests.

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
    | Request-ID (8)|         Algorithm (16)        | Signature(*)...
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+


                 Figure 6: CERTIFICATE_PROOF frame payload

   The "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame (0xFRAME-TBD4) contains an "Algorithm"
   field (a "SignatureAndHashAlgorithm", from [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]
   section 6.3.2.1), describing the hash/signature algorithm pair being
   used.  The signature is performed as described in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], with the following values being used:

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs                March 2016


   o  The context string for the signature is "HTTP/2 CERTIFICATE_PROOF"

   o  The "specified content" is an [RFC5705] exported value, with the
      following parameters:

      *  Disambiguating label string: "EXPORTER HTTP/2
         CERTIFICATE_PROOF"

      *  Length: 64 bytes

   Because the exported value can be independently calculated by both
   sides of the TLS connection, the value to be signed is not sent on
   the wire at any time.  The same signed value is used for all
   "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frames in a single HTTP/2 connection.

   A "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame MUST be sent only after all "CERTIFICATE"
   frames with the same Request-ID have been sent, and MUST correspond
   to the first certificate presented in the first "CERTIFICATE" frame
   with that Request-ID.  Receipt of multiple "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frames
   for the same Request-ID, receipt of a "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame
   without a corresponding "CERTIFICATE" frame, or receipt of a
   "CERTIFICATE" frame after a corresponding "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" MUST be
   treated as a session error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

   If the "AUTOMATIC_USE" flag is set, the server MAY omit sending
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frames on future streams associated with this
   request and use the referenced certificate for authentication without
   further notice to the client.  This behavior is optional, and receipt
   of a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame does not imply that previously-
   presented certificates were unacceptable to the server.

   Use of the "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame by servers is not defined by
   this document.  A "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame received by a client MUST
   be ignored.

3.  Indicating failures during HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

   Because this draft permits client certificates to be exchanged at the
   HTTP framing layer instead of the TLS layer, several certificate-
   related errors which are defined at the TLS layer might now occur at
   the HTTP framing layer.  In this section, those errors are restated
   and added to the HTTP/2 error code registry.

   BAD_CERTIFICATE (0xERROR-TBD1):  A certificate was corrupt, contained
      signatures that did not verify correctly, etc.

   UNSUPPORTED_CERTIFICATE (0xERROR-TBD2):  A certificate was of an
      unsupported type or did not contain required extensions

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs                March 2016


   CERTIFICATE_REVOKED (0xERROR-TBD3):  A certificate was revoked by its
      signer

   CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED (0xERROR-TBD4):  A certificate has expired or is
      not currently valid

   BAD_SIGNATURE (0xERROR-TBD5):  The digital signature provided did not
      match

   CERTIFICATE_TOO_LARGE (0xERROR-TBD6):  The certificate cannot be
      transferred due to the recipient's "SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE"

   CERTIFICATE_GENERAL (0xERROR-TBD7):  Any other certificate-related
      error

   As described in [RFC7540], implementations MAY choose to treat a
   stream error as a connection error at any time.  Of particular note,
   a stream error cannot occur on stream 0, which means that
   implementations cannot send non-session errors in response to
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" and "CERTIFICATE" frames.  Implementations
   which do not wish to terminate the connection MAY either send
   relevant errors on any stream which references the failing
   certificate in question or process the requests as unauthenticated
   and provide error information at the HTTP semantic layer.

4.  Indicating Support for HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

   Clients that support HTTP-layer certificate authentication indicate
   this using the HTTP/2 "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" (0xSETTING-TBD)
   setting.

   The initial value for the "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" setting is 0,
   indicating that the client does not support reactive certificate
   authentication.  A client sets the "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" setting
   to a value of 1 to indicate support for HTTP-layer certificate
   authentication as defined in this document.  Any value other than 0
   or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error (Section 5.4.1 of
   [RFC7540]) of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

5.  Security Considerations

   Failure to provide a certificate on a stream after receiving
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" blocks server processing, and SHOULD be
   subject to standard timeouts used to guard against unresponsive
   peers.

   In order to protect the privacy of the connection against triple-
   handshake attacks, this feature of HTTP/2 MUST be used only over TLS



Thomson & Bishop       Expires September 15, 2016              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs                March 2016


   1.3 or greater, or over TLS 1.2 in combination with the Extended
   Master Secret extension defined in [RFC7627].  Because this feature
   is intended to operate with equivalent security to the TLS
   connection, hash and signature algorithms not permitted by the
   version of TLS in use MUST NOT be used.  Additionally, the following
   algorithms MUST NOT be used, even if permitted by the underlying TLS
   version:

   o  MD5

   o  SHA1

   o  SHA224

   o  DSA

   o  ECDSA with curves on prime fields that are less than 240 bits wide

   o  RSA with a prime modulus less than 2048 bits

   Client implementations need to carefully consider the impact of
   setting the "AUTOMATIC_USE" flag.  This flag is a performance
   optimization, permitting the client to avoid a round-trip on each
   request where the server checks for certificate authentication.
   However, once this flag has been sent, the client has zero knowledge
   about whether the server will use the referenced cert for any future
   request, or even for an existing request which has not yet completed.
   Clients MUST NOT set this flag on any certificate which is not
   appropriate for currently-in-flight requests, and MUST NOT make any
   future requests on the same connection which they do not intend to
   have associated with the provided certificate.

   Implementations need to be aware of the potential for confusion about
   the state of a connection.  The presence or absence of a validated
   client certificate can change during the processing of a request,
   potentially multiple times, as "USE_CERTIFICATE" frames are received.
   A server that uses certificate authentication needs to be prepared to
   reevaluate the authorization state of a request as the set of
   certificates changes.

   The HTTP/2 "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" setting is registered in
   Section 6.1.  Five frame types are registered in Section 6.2.  Six
   error codes are registered in Section 6.3.
