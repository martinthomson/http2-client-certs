       Reactive Certificate-Based Client Authentication in HTTP/2
                draft-thomson-http2-client-certs-latest

Abstract

   Some HTTP servers provide a subset of resources that require
   additional authentication to interact with.  HTTP/1.1 servers rely on
   TLS renegotiation that is triggered by a request to a protected
   resource.  HTTP/2 made this pattern impossible by forbidding the use
   of TLS renegotiation.  While TLS 1.3 provides an alternate mechanism
   to obtain client certificates, this mechanism does not map well to
   usage in TLS 1.2.

   This document describes a how client authentication might be
   requested by a server as a result of receiving a request to a
   protected resource.

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs             December 2015


1.  Introduction

   Many existing HTTP [RFC7230] servers have different authentication
   requirements for the different resources they serve.  Of the
   bountiful authentication options available for authenticating HTTP
   requests, client certificates present a unique challenge for
   resource-specific authentication requirements because of the
   interaction with the underlying TLS RFC5246 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]
   layer.

   For servers that wish to use client certificates to authenticate
   users, they might request client authentication during or immediately
   after the TLS handshake.  However, if not all users or resources need
   certificate-based authentication, a request for a certificate has the
   unfortunate consequence of triggering the client to seek a
   certificate.  Such a request can result in a poor experience,
   particularly when sent to a client that does not expect the request.

   The TLS 1.3 CertificateRequest can be used by servers to give clients
   hints about which certificate to offer.  Servers that rely on
   certificate-based authentication might request different certificates
   for different resources.  Such a server cannot use contextual
   information about the resource to construct an appropriate TLS
   CertificateRequest message during the initial handshake.

   Consequently, client certificates are requested at connection
   establishment time only in cases where all clients are expected or
   required to have a single certificate that is used for all resources.
   Many other uses for client certificates are reactive, that is,
   certificates are requested in response to the client making a
   request.

   In Yokohama, there was extensive working group discussion regarding
   why certificate authentication could not easily be done at the HTTP
   semantic layer.  However, in subsequent discussion, it became
   apparent that the HTTP _framing_ layer did not suffer from the same
   limitation.

   In this document, a mechanism for doing certificate-based client
   authentication via HTTP/2 frames is defined.  This mechanism can be
   implemented at the HTTP layer without requiring new TLS stack
   behavior and without breaking the existing interface between HTTP and
   applications which employ client certificates.

1.1.  Reactive Certificate Authentication in HTTP/1.1

1.1.1.  Using TLS 1.2 and previous

   In HTTP/1.1, a server that relies on client authentication for a
   subset of users or resources does not request a certificate when the
   connection is established.  Instead, it only requests a client
   certificate when a request is made to a resource that requires a
   certificate.  TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] accomodates this by permitting the
   server to request a new TLS handshake, in which the server will
   request the client's certificate.

   Figure 1 shows the server initiating a TLS-layer renegotiation in
   response to receiving an HTTP/1.1 request to a protected resource.

   Client                                      Server
      -- (HTTP) GET /protected -------------------> *1
      <---------------------- (TLS) HelloRequest -- *2
      -- (TLS) ClientHello ----------------------->
      <------------------ (TLS) ServerHello, ... --
      <---------------- (TLS) CertificateRequest -- *3
      -- (TLS) ..., Certificate ------------------> *4
      -- (TLS) Finished -------------------------->
      <-------------------------- (TLS) Finished --
      <--------------------------- (HTTP) 200 OK -- *5

    Figure 1: HTTP/1.1 Reactive Certificate Authentication with TLS 1.2

   In this example, the server receives a request for a protected
   resource (at *1 on Figure 1).  Upon performing an authorization
   check, the server determines that the request requires authentication
   using a client certificate and that no such certificate has been
   provided.

   The server initiates TLS renegotiation by sending a TLS HelloRequest
   (at *2).  The client then initiates a TLS handshake.  Note that some
   TLS messages are elided from the exchange for the sake of brevity.

   The critical messages for this example are the server requesting a
   certificate with a TLS CertificateRequest (*3); this request might
   use information about the request or resource.  The client then
   provides a certificate and proof of possession of the private key in
   Certificate and CertificateVerify messages (*4).

   When the handshake completes, the server performs any authorization
   checks a second time.  With the client certificate available, it then
   authorizes the request and provides a response (*5).

1.1.2.  Using TLS 1.3

   TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] introduces a new client authentication
   mechanism that allows for clients to authenticate after the handshake
   has been completed.  For the purposes of authenticating an HTTP
   request, this is functionally equivalent to renegotiation.  Figure 2
   shows the simpler exchange this enables.

   Client                                      Server
      -- (HTTP) GET /protected ------------------->
      <---------------- (TLS) CertificateRequest --
      -- (TLS) Certificate ----------------------->
      <--------------------------- (HTTP) 200 OK --

    Figure 2: HTTP/1.1 Reactive Certificate Authentication with TLS 1.3

   TLS 1.3 does not support renegotiation, instead supporting direct
   client authentication.  In contrast to the TLS 1.2 example, in TLS
   1.3, a server can simply request a certificate.

1.2.  Reactive Client Authentication in HTTP/2

   An important part of the HTTP/1.1 exchange is that the client is able
   to easily identify the request that caused the TLS renegotiation.
   The client is able to assume that the next unanswered request on the
   connection is responsible.  The HTTP stack in the client is then able
   to direct the certificate request to the application or component
   that initiated that request.  This ensures that the application has
   the right contextual information for processing the request.

   In HTTP/2, a client can have multiple outstanding requests.  Without
   some sort of correlation information, a client is unable to identify
   which request caused the server to request a certificate.

   Thus, the minimum necessary mechanism to support reactive certificate
   authentication in HTTP/2 is an identifier that can be use to
   correlate an HTTP request with either a TLS renegotiation or
   CertificateRequest.

   Such an identifier could be added to TLS 1.2 by means of an
   extension, but many TLS 1.2 implementations do not permit application
   data to continue during a renegotiation.  This is problematic for a
   multiplexed protocol like HTTP/2.  Instead, this draft proposes
   bringing the TLS 1.3 CertificateRequest and Certificate messages into
   HTTP/2 frames, making client certificate authentication TLS-version-
   agnostic.

   Section 2 describes how certificates can be requested and presented
   at the HTTP/2 framing layer using several new frame types which
   parallel the TLS 1.3 message exchange.  Section 3 defines new error
   types which can be used to notify peers when the exchange has not
   been successful.  Finally, Section 4 describes how an HTTP/2 client
   can announce support for this feature so that a server might use
   these capabilities.

1.3.  Terminology

   RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the terms "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and
   "MAY".

2.  Presenting Client Certificates at the HTTP/2 Framing Layer

   An HTTP/2 request from a client that has signaled support for
   reactive certificate authentication (see Section 4) might cause a
   server to request client authentication.  In HTTP/2 a server does
   this by sending at least one "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame (see
   Section 2.1) on stream zero.

   The server SHOULD first send a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame (see
   Section 2.2) on the stream which triggered the request for client
   credentials.  The Request-ID field of the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame
   is populated by the server with the same value in the
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame.  Subsequent "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED"
   frames with the same request identifier MAY be sent on other streams
   where the server is expecting client authentication with the same
   parameters.  This allows a client to correlate the
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" with one or more outstanding HTTP requests.

   A server MAY send multiple concurrent "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frames.
   If a server requires that a client provide multiple certificates
   before authorizing a single request, it MUST send a
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame with a different request identifier and

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs             December 2015


   a corresponding "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame for each required
   certificate.

   Clients provide certificate authentication by sending a "CERTIFICATE"
   frame (see Section 2.3) on stream zero.  If the "CERTIFICATE" frame
   is marked as both "SOLICITED" and "AUTOMATIC_USE", the provided
   certificate can be immediately applied by the server to all streams
   on which a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame has been sent previously with
   the same identifier.  Otherwise, the client will send subsequent
   "USE_CERTIFICATE" frames (see Section 2.5) to indicate the streams on
   which it intends the certificate to be considered.

   Clients may also provide authentication without being asked, if
   desired, by sending "CERTIFICATE" and "USE_CERTIFICATE" frames
   without waiting for a server-generated "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST".  If a
   client receives a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame referencing parameters
   for which it has already provided a matching certificate, it MAY
   reply with a "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame referencing the previous
   "CERTIFICATE" frame.

2.1.  The CERTIFICATE_REQUEST Frame

   TLS 1.3 defines the "CertificateRequest" message, which prompts the
   client to provide a certificate which conforms to certain properties
   specified by the server.  This draft defines the
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame (0xFRAME-TBD1), which contains the same
   contents as a TLS 1.3 "CertificateRequest" message, but can be sent
   over any TLS version.

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame MUST NOT be sent by clients.  A
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame received by a server SHOULD be rejected
   with a stream error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame MUST be sent on stream zero.  A
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame received on any other stream MUST be
   rejected with a stream error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

                Figure 4: CERTIFICATE_REQUEST frame payload

   The frame contains the following fields:

   ID-Length and Request-ID:  "Request-ID" is a variable-length opaque
      identifier used to correlate subsequent certificate-related frames
      with this request.  The identifier MUST be the output of a
      cryptographically-secure pseudo-random function.  The size of the
      "Request-ID" field is given by the 8-bit "ID-Length" field, which
      MUST NOT be zero.

   Algorithm-Count and Algorithms:  A list of the hash/signature
      algorithm pairs that the server is able to verify, listed in
      descending order of preference.  Any certificates provided by the
      client MUST be signed using a hash/signature algorithm pair found
      in "Algorithms".  Each algorithm pair is encoded as a
      "SignatureAndHashAlgorithm" (see [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] section
      6.3.2.1), and the number of such structures is given by the 16-bit
      "Algorithm-Count" field, which MUST NOT be zero.

   CA-Count and Certificate-Authorities:  "Certificate-Authorities" is a
      series of distinguished names of acceptable certificate
      authorities, represented in DER-encoded [X690] format.  These
      distinguished names may specify a desired distinguished name for a
      root CA or for a subordinate CA; thus, this message can be used to
      describe known roots as well as a desired authorization space.
      The number of such structures is given by the 16-bit "CA-Count"
      field, which MAY be zero.  If the "CA-Count" field is zero, then
      the client MAY send any certificate that meets the rest of the
      selection criteria in the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST", unless there is
      some external arrangement to the contrary.

   Cert-Extension-Count and Cert-Extensions:  A list of certificate
      extension OIDs [RFC5280] with their allowed values, represented in
      a series of "CertificateExtension" structures (see
      [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] section 6.3.5).  The list of OIDs MUST be

      used in certificate selection as described in
      [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  The number of Cert-Extension structures is
      given by the 16-bit "Cert-Extension-Count" field, which MAY be
      zero.

   Some certificate extension OIDs allow multiple values (e.g.  Extended
   Key Usage).  If the sender has included a non-empty
   certificate_extensions list, the certificate MUST contain all of the
   specified extension OIDs that the recipient recognizes.  For each
   extension OID recognized by the recipient, all of the specified
   values MUST be present in the certificate (but the certificate MAY
   have other values as well).  However, the recipient MUST ignore and
   skip any unrecognized certificate extension OIDs.

   PKIX RFCs define a variety of certificate extension OIDs and their
   corresponding value types.  Depending on the type, matching
   certificate extension values are not necessarily bitwise-equal.  It
   is expected that implementations will rely on their PKI libraries to
   perform certificate selection using these certificate extension OIDs.

2.2.  The CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED frame

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame (0xFRAME-TBD2) is sent by servers to
   indicate that processing of a request is blocked pending certificate
   authentication.  The frame includes a request identifier which can be
   used to correlate the stream with a "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame
   received on stream zero.

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame contains between 1 and 255 octets,
   which is the authentication request identifier.  A client that
   receives a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" of any other length MUST treat this
   as a stream error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".  Frames with identical
   request identifiers refer to the same "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST".

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame MUST NOT be sent by clients.  A
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame received by a server SHOULD be rejected
   with a stream error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The server MUST NOT send a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame on stream
   zero, a server-initiated stream or a stream that does not have an
   outstanding request.  In other words, a server can only send in the
   "open" or "half-closed (remote)" stream states.

   A client that receives a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame on a stream
   which is not in a valid state ("open" or "half-closed (local)" for
   clients) SHOULD treat this as a connection error of type
   "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

2.3.  The CERTIFICATE frame

   The "CERTIFICATE" frame (0xFRAME-TBD3) allows the sender to provide
   elements of a certificate chain which can be used as authentication
   for previous or subsequent requests.

   The "CERTIFICATE" frame defines one flag:

   SOLICITED (0x01): : If set, indicates that the "CERTIFICATE" (and
   possibly "CERTIFICATE_PROOF") frame(s) are being sent in response to
   a "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame.

   The payload of a "CERTIFICATE" frame contains elements of a
   certificate chain, terminating in an end certificate.  Multiple
   "CERTIFICATE" frames MAY be sent with the same Certificate-ID, to
   accomodate certificate chains which are too large to fit in a single
   HTTP/2 frame (see [RFC7540] section 4.2).  The flag values MUST be
   identical for each "CERTIFICATE" frame sent with the same
   Certificate-ID.

   Particularly when a certificate contains a large number of Subject
   Alternative Names, it might not fit into a single "CERTIFICATE" frame
   even as the only provided certificate.  Senders unable to transfer a
   requested certificate due to the recipient's
   "SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE" value SHOULD increase their own
   "SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE" to a size that would accomodate their
   certificate, then terminate affected streams with
   "CERTIFICATE_TOO_LARGE".

   Use of the "CERTIFICATE" frame by servers is not defined by this
   document.  A "CERTIFICATE" frame received by a client MUST be
   ignored.

   The "CERTIFICATE" frame MUST be sent on stream zero.  A "CERTIFICATE"

   The fields defined by the "CERTIFICATE" frame are:

   ID-Length and Certificate-ID:  If the "CERTIFICATE" frame is in
      response to a "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" from the server, the ID of
      that request.  Otherwise, a client-selected identifier for this
      certificate.  The identifier MUST be the output of a
      cryptographically-secure pseudo-random function.

   Cert-Count and Certificate-List:  A sequence of Certificate objects
      (see Section 2.3.1), each representing one certificate in the
      sender's certificate chain.  For the first or only "CERTIFICATE"
      frame with a given Certificate-ID, the sender's certificate MUST
      be the first in the list.  Each subsequent certificate SHOULD
      directly certify the certificate immediately preceding it.  A
      certificate which specifies a trust anchor MAY be omitted,
      provided that the recipient is known to already possess the
      relevant certificate.  (For example, because it was included in a
      "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST"'s Certificate-Authorities list.)  "Cert-
      Count" describes the number of certificates provided.

   A "CERTIFICATE" frame with a "Cert-Count" of zero indicates a refusal
   of a "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" - the sender either does not have or does
   not wish to provide a matching certificate.  Servers SHOULD process
   all corresponding requests as unauthenticated, likely returning an
   authentication-related error at the HTTP level (e.g. 403).

   If the "CERTIFICATE" frame is sent without being requested, the
   "SOLICITED" flag MUST NOT be set.  When the "CERTIFICATE" frame is
   sent in response to a "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame, the "SOLICITED"
   flag MUST be set, and the "Request-ID" field MUST contain the same
   value as the corresponding "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame.  In this
   case, the provided certificate chain MUST conform to the requirements
   expressed in the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" to the best of the client's
   ability.  Specifically:

   o  If the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" contained a non-empty "Certificate-
      Authorities" element, one of the certificates in the chain SHOULD
      be signed by one of the listed CAs.

   o  If the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" contained a non-empty "Cert-
      Extensions" element, the first certificate MUST match with regard
      to the extension OIDs recognized by the client.

   o  Each certificate that is not self-signed MUST be signed using a
      hash/signature algorithm listed in the "Algorithms" element.

   If these requirements are not satisfied, the server MAY at its
   discretion either process the request without client authentication,

   or respond with a stream error [RFC7540] on any stream where the
   certificate is used.  Section 3 defines certificate-related error
   codes which might be applicable.

                      Figure 6: Certificate structure

   The Certificate structure is a length-prefixed X.509v3 [RFC5280]
   certificate.  The certificate MUST be signed with an acceptable hash/
   signature algorithm pair, if the recipient's list of acceptable pairs
   is known.

2.4.  The CERTIFICATE_PROOF Frame

   The "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame proves possession of the private key
   corresponding to an end certificate previously shown in a
   "CERTIFICATE" frame, along with its certificate chain in the same or
   other "CERTIFICATE" frames.

   The "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame defines two flags:

   SOLICITED (0x01):  If set, indicates that the "CERTIFICATE" and
      "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frames are being sent in response to a
      "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame.

   AUTOMATIC_USE (0x02):  If set, the recipient SHOULD consider the
      certificate when authenticating future requests.  Otherwise, the
      certificate MUST only be considered for requests on streams where
      a "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame (see Section 2.5) has been sent.

                 Figure 7: CERTIFICATE_PROOF frame payload

   The "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame (0xFRAME-TBD4) contains an "Algorithm"
   field (a "SignatureAndHashAlgorithm", from [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]
   section 6.3.2.1), describing the hash/signature algorithm pair being
   used.  The signature is performed as described in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], with the following values being used:

   o  The context string for the signature is "HTTP/2 CERTIFICATE"

   o  The "specified content" is an [RFC5705] exported value, with the
      following parameters:

      *  Disambiguating label string: "EXPORTER HTTP/2 CERTIFICATE"

      *  Context: The Certificate-ID chosen by the application

      *  Length: 1024 bytes

   Because the exported value can be independently calculated by both
   sides of the TLS connection, the value to be signed is not sent on
   the wire at any time.

   A "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame MUST be sent only after all "CERTIFICATE"
   frames with the same Certificate-ID have been sent, and MUST
   correspond to the first certificate presented in the first
   "CERTIFICATE" frame with that Certificate-ID.  Receipt of multiple
   "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frames for the same Certificate-ID, receipt of a
   "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame without a corresponding "CERTIFICATE"
   frame, or receipt of a "CERTIFICATE" frame after a corresponding
   "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" MUST be treated as a session error of type
   "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

   Use of the "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame by servers is not defined by
   this document.  A "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame received by a client MUST
   be ignored.

2.5.  The USE_CERTIFICATE Frame

   The "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame (0xFRAME-TBD5) is sent by clients to
   indicate that processing of a request should use a certificate
   provided in a previous "CERTIFICATE" frame and proved by a preceding
   "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame.  The frame includes a certificate
   identifier which can be used to correlate the stream with a
   "CERTIFICATE" frame received on stream zero.

   A "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame with no payload expresses the client's
   choice to proceed without providing a certificate.  Servers SHOULD
   process the request as unauthenticated, likely returning an
   authentication-related error at the HTTP level (e.g. 403).

   Otherwise, the "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame contains between 1 and 255
   octets, which is the authentication request identifier.  A server
   that receives a "USE_CERTIFICATE" of any other length MUST treat this
   as a stream error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".  Frames with identical
   request identifiers refer to the same "CERTIFICATE".

   Use of the "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame by servers is not defined by this
   document.  A "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame received by a client MUST be
   ignored.

   The client MUST NOT send a "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame on stream zero, a
   server-initiated stream or a stream that does not have an outstanding
   request.  In other words, a client can only send in the "open" or
   "half-closed (local)" stream states.

   A server that receives a "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame on a stream which is
   not in a valid state ("open" or "half-closed (remote)" for servers)
   SHOULD treat this as a connection error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

3.  Indicating failures during HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

   Because this draft permits client certificates to be exchanged at the
   HTTP framing layer instead of the TLS layer, several certificate-
   related errors which are defined at the TLS layer might now occur at
   the HTTP framing layer.  In this section, those errors are restated
   and added to the HTTP/2 error code registry.

   BAD_CERTIFICATE (0xERROR-TBD1):  A certificate was corrupt, contained
      signatures that did not verify correctly, etc.

   UNSUPPORTED_CERTIFICATE (0xERROR-TBD2):  A certificate was of an
      unsupported type

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2 Client Certs             December 2015


   CERTIFICATE_REVOKED (0xERROR-TBD3):  A certificate was revoked by its
      signer

   CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED (0xERROR-TBD4):  A certificate has expired or is
      not currently valid

   BAD_SIGNATURE (0xERROR-TBD5):  The digital signature provided did not
      match

   CERTIFICATE_TOO_LARGE (0xERROR-TBD6):  The certificate cannot be
      transferred due to the recipient's "SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE"

   CERTIFICATE_GENERAL (0xERROR-TBD7):  Any other certificate-related
      error

   As described in [RFC7540], implementations MAY choose to treat a
   stream error as a connection error at any time.  Of particular note,
   a stream error cannot occur on stream 0, which means that
   implementations cannot send non-session errors in response to
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" and "CERTIFICATE" frames.  Implementations
   which do not wish to terminate the connection MAY either send
   relevant errors on any stream which references the failing
   certificate in question or process the requests as unauthenticated
   and provide error information at the HTTP semantic layer.

4.  Indicating Support for HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

   Clients that support HTTP-layer certificate authentication indicate
   this using the HTTP/2 "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" (0xSETTING-TBD)
   setting.

   The initial value for the "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" setting is 0,
   indicating that the client does not support reactive certificate
   authentication.  A client sets the "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" setting
   to a value of 1 to indicate support for HTTP-layer certificate
   authentication as defined in this document.  Any value other than 0
   or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error (Section 5.4.1 of
   [RFC7540]) of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

5.  Security Considerations

   Implementations need to be aware of the potential for confusion about
   the state of a connection.  Because a client's unsolicited
   certificate might race with the server's request for a certificate,
   failure to answer a "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" is not necessarily an
   attack.  At the same time, failure to provide a certificate on a
   stream after receiving "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" blocks server

   processing, and SHOULD be subject to standard timeouts used to guard
   against unresponsive peers.

   The presence or absence of a validated client certificate can change
   during the processing of a request, potentially multiple times.  A
   server that uses reactive certificate authentication needs to be
   prepared to reevaluate the authorization state of a request as the
   set of certificates changes.  This might occur without frames on-
   stream, if a "CERTIFICATE" frame with the "AUTOMATIC_USE" flag is
   received.
