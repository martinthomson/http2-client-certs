         Secondary Server-Certificate Authentication in HTTP/2
           draft-bishop-httpbis-http2-additional-certs-latest

Abstract

   Many HTTP servers host content from several origins.  HTTP/2
   [RFC7540] permits clients to reuse an existing HTTP connection to a
   server provided that certain conditions are satisfied.  One of these
   conditions is the inclusion of the secondary origin in the
   certificate provided during the TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] handshake.

   In many cases, origins will wish to maintain separate certificates
   for different origins but still desire the benefits of a shared HTTP
   connection.  This draft describes how frames which were defined to
   transfer client certificates might be used to provide additional
   server certificates as well.

1.  Introduction

   Section 9.1.1 of [RFC7540] describes how connections may be reused as
   long as the server is authoritative for both origins.  A server is
   considered authoritative for both origins if DNS resolves both
   origins to the IP address of the server and (for TLS) if the
   certificate presented by the server contains both origins, either as
   the Subject or contained in the Subject Alternative Names field.

   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-alt-svc] enables a step of abstraction from the DNS
   resolution.  If both hosts have provided an Alternative Service at
   hostnames which resolve to the IP address of the server, they are
   considered authoritative just as if DNS resolved the origin itself to
   that address.

   The ORIGIN extension frame, defined in
   [I-D.nottingham-httpbis-origin-frame], provides a negative coalescing
   feature - a way for a server to request that a client _not_ reuse a
   connection for an origin, even when it might otherwise appear to be

   supported.  However, the ORIGIN frame does not currently permit a
   server to advertise the availability of origins which do not appear
   in the server's certificate as presented in the TLS handshake.

   Servers which host many origins often would prefer to have separate
   certificates for some sets of origins.  This may be for ease of
   certificate management (the ability to separately revoke or renew
   them), for legal reasons (a CDN acting on behalf of multiple
   origins), or any other factor which might drive this administrative
   decision.  Clients connecting to such origins cannot currently reuse
   connections, even if both client and server would be willing to do
   so.

   [I-D.thomson-http2-client-certs] defines certificate-related HTTP/2
   frames, permitting a sender to offer a certificate chain along with
   proof that it possesses the corresponding private key to the end
   certificate.  These frames are bound to the underlying TLS session,
   so that the certificates are as reliable as those provided at the TLS
   layer.

   In this document, a mechanism for using these frames for secondary
   server authentication via HTTP/2 frames is defined.  This mechanism
   can be implemented at the HTTP layer without requiring new TLS stack
   behavior and without breaking the existing interface between HTTP and
   applications above it.  It primarily relaxes the one-way nature of
   the frames defined in [I-D.thomson-http2-client-certs], defining the
   processing of these frames in the reverse direction.

1.1.  Origin Discovery

1.1.1.  Client-driven discovery

   As defined in [RFC7540], when a client finds that a https:// origin
   (or Alternative Service [I-D.ietf-httpbis-alt-svc]) to which it needs
   to make a request has the same IP address as a server to which it is
   already connected, it MAY check whether the TLS certificate provided
   contains the new origin as well, and if so, reuse the connection.

   If not, but the server has advertised support for HTTP-layer
   certificates, the client MAY also send a "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame
   Section 2.1 on stream zero requesting a certificate for the desired
   origin.  The server responds with a series of "CERTIFICATE" frames
   containing the relevant certificate chain, if it possesses such a
   certificate.  If not, the server responds with an empty "CERTIFICATE"
   frame.

1.1.2.  Server-driven discovery

   Because the approach in Section 1.1.1 requires an extra round-trip to
   the server before the client can determine whether a new TCP
   connection will be required, some origins will wish to proactively
   alert clients to certificates they possess.  Servers might also wish
   to proactively prove their authority for an origin for which it
   intends to deliver pushed resources.

   The server MAY send an "ORIGIN" frame including origins which are not
   in its TLS certificate.  This represents an explicit claim by the
   server to possess the appropriate certificate - a claim the client
   MUST verify using the procedures in Section 1.1.1 before relying on
   the server's authority for the claimed origin.

   The server might push resources from an origin for which it is
   authoritative but for which the client has not received the
   certificate.  In this case, the client SHOULD verify the server's
   possession of an appropriate certificate by sending a
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame on the pushed stream and a
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" on stream zero.  The client MUST NOT use the
   pushed resource until an appropriate certificate has been received
   and validated.

2.  Presenting Server Certificates at the HTTP/2 Framing Layer

   {#certs-http2}

   When a client wishes to obtain additional certificates from a server
   that has signaled support for HTTP certificate authentication (see
   Section 4), it does this by sending at least one
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame (see Section 2.1) on stream zero.  A
   client MAY send multiple concurrent "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frames.  If
   server-initiated streams are blocked until the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST"
   has been answered, the client SHOULD send "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED"
   frames on those streams to inform the server.

   Servers respond to certificate authentication requests by sending one
   or more "CERTIFICATE" frames (see Section 2.3) followed by a
   "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame, on stream zero.

2.1.  The CERTIFICATE_REQUEST Frame

   When the server has advertised support for HTTP certificate
   authentication (see Section 4), clients MAY send the
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame.  A server that has advertised support
   MUST NOT treat receipt of such a frame as a session error of type
   "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

Internet-Draft           HTTP/2 Additional Certs              March 2016


   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame MUST be sent on stream zero.  A
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame received on any other stream MUST be
   rejected with a stream error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

   When sent from client to server, the "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame has
   the same layout, with one change to the field definitions.  The "CA-
   Count" and "Certificate-Authorities" fields are replaced by "Origin-
   Count" and "Origins" fields, with the same length and format.
   "Origins" is the distinguished name of the origin for which the
   client wishes to obtain a certificate, represented in DER-encoded
   [X690] format.  The number of such structures is given by the 16-bit
   "Origin-Count" field, which MUST be one (0x01).

2.2.  The CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED frame

   The "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame is sent by clients to indicate that
   processing of a server-initiated stream (for example, a pushed
   resource) is blocked pending certificate authentication.  The frame
   includes a request identifier which can be used to correlate the
   stream with a "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frame received on stream zero.
   The layout and fields are unmodified from
   [I-D.thomson-http2-client-certs].

   When the server has advertised support for HTTP certificate
   authentication (see Section 4), clients MAY send the
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame.  A server that has advertised support
   MUST NOT treat receipt of such a frame as a stream error of type
   "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

   The client MUST NOT send a "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame on stream
   zero or a client-initiated stream.  A server that receives a
   "CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED" frame on an inappropriate stream SHOULD treat
   this as a connection error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

2.3.  The CERTIFICATE frame

   The "CERTIFICATE" frame allows the sender to present a certificate
   which should be used as authentication for previous or subsequent
   requests.

   The payload of a "CERTIFICATE" frame contains elements of a
   certificate chain, terminating in an end certificate.  The layout,
   fields, and processing are unmodified from
   [I-D.thomson-http2-client-certs].

Internet-Draft           HTTP/2 Additional Certs              March 2016


2.4.  The CERTIFICATE_PROOF Frame

   The "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame allows the sender to prove possession
   of a certificate which should be used as authentication for previous
   or subsequent requests.  The payload of a "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame
   contains proof of possession of the private key corresponding to an
   end certificate previously presented in a series of "CERTIFICATE"
   frames.  The layout, fields, and processing are unmodified from
   [I-D.thomson-http2-client-certs].

   Servers MUST set the "AUTOMATIC_USE" flag when sending a
   "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frame.

2.5.  The USE_CERTIFICATE Frame

   The "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame is sent by servers to indicate that
   processing of a server-initiated stream should use a certificate
   provided in a previous series of "CERTIFICATE" and
   "CERTIFICATE_PROOF" frames.  The frame includes a certificate
   identifier which can be used to correlate the stream with a
   certificate received on stream zero.

   A "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame with no payload expresses the server's
   choice to proceed without providing a certificate.  Clients SHOULD
   process the request as authenticated solely by the certificate
   provided at the TLS layer, likely by discarding the pushed resource
   and terminating the stream.

   Otherwise, the "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame contains a single octet, which
   is the authentication request identifier.  A server that receives a
   "USE_CERTIFICATE" of any other length MUST treat this as a stream
   error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".  Frames with identical request
   identifiers refer to the same certificate chain.

   The server MUST NOT send a "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame on stream zero or
   a client-initiated stream.  A client that receives a
   "USE_CERTIFICATE" frame on an inappropriate stream SHOULD treat this
   as a connection error of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

3.  Indicating failures during Certificate Authentication

   The errors defined by [I-D.thomson-http2-client-certs] MAY be used by
   either clients or servers, as appropriate.

Internet-Draft           HTTP/2 Additional Certs              March 2016


4.  Indicating Support for HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

   Servers that support HTTP-layer certificate authentication indicate
   this using the HTTP/2 "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" setting defined in
   [I-D.thomson-http2-client-certs].

   The initial value for the "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" setting is 0,
   indicating that the server does not support HTTP-layer certificate
   authentication.  A server sets the "SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH" setting
   to a value of 1 to indicate support for HTTP-layer certificate
   authentication as defined in this document.  Any value other than 0
   or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error (Section 5.4.1 of
   [RFC7540]) of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

5.  Security Considerations

   This mechanism defines an alternate way to obtain server certificates
   other than the TLS handshake.  While the signature of exporter values
   is expected to be equally secure, it is important to recognize that a
   vulnerability in this code path is equal to a vulnerability in the
   TLS handshake.

   This draft defines a mechanism which could be used to probe servers
   for origins they support, but opens no new attack versus making
   repeat TLS connections with different SNI values.  Servers SHOULD
   impose similar denial-of-service mitigations (e.g. request rate
   limits) to "CERTIFICATE_REQUEST" frames as to new TLS connections.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No changes are made to the registrations in
   [I-D.thomson-http2-client-certs].
